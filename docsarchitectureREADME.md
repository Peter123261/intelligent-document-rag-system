\# System Architecture



\## High-Level Overview



Our RAG system follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns:



\### Core Components



1\. \*\*API Gateway Layer\*\*

&nbsp;  - FastAPI application server

&nbsp;  - Request validation and routing

&nbsp;  - Rate limiting and authentication

&nbsp;  - API versioning (v1, v2)



2\. \*\*RAG Processing Engine\*\*

&nbsp;  - Document ingestion pipeline

&nbsp;  - Text chunking and preprocessing

&nbsp;  - Embedding generation and storage

&nbsp;  - Query processing and optimization



3\. \*\*Vector Database Layer\*\*

&nbsp;  - Pinecone for production vector search

&nbsp;  - PostgreSQL for metadata and relationships

&nbsp;  - Redis for caching and sessions



4\. \*\*LLM Orchestration\*\*

&nbsp;  - Multi-provider LLM routing

&nbsp;  - Query complexity analysis

&nbsp;  - Response optimization and caching



\## Data Flow


Document Upload → Text Extraction → Chunking → Embedding → Vector Storage

↓

User Query → Query Rewriting → Vector Search → Context Retrieval → LLM Processing → Response



\## Scalability Considerations



\- \*\*Horizontal Scaling\*\*: ECS auto-scaling based on CPU and memory

\- \*\*Database Sharding\*\*: Vector embeddings distributed across Pinecone pods

\- \*\*Caching Strategy\*\*: Multi-layer caching with Redis and CloudFront

\- \*\*Load Balancing\*\*: Application Load Balancer with health checks



\## Security Architecture



\- \*\*Authentication\*\*: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism

\- \*\*Authorization\*\*: Role-based access control (RBAC)

\- \*\*Data Encryption\*\*: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit

\- \*\*Network Security\*\*: VPC with private subnets for databases
